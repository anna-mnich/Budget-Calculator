<h1>Budget Calculator</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Budget calculator is a program with which users can calculate their monthly budget. The problem to solve is to help users to see how much of their income goes towards rent, food, internet, and what the remaining balance is. I will create a program to solve this problem.
When executed, the program will ask the user to input their income, rent cost, food cost, and internet cost.
After that, the program will calculate the remaining balance by subtracting rent, food, and internet costs from the income, and display the results.
